## Dataset Description
City Bike data is valuable for urban planners, transportation authorities, and data analysts. It enables the study of urban mobility trends, helps optimize bike-sharing programs, and informs decisions related to city transportation infrastructure and sustainability initiatives. Analyzing this data can lead to insights into improving transportation options and reducing congestion in urban areas.

## Purpose
The purpose of this Snowflake project is to leverage the power of data warehousing to analyze City Bike data and extract valuable insights into urban transportation trends. By delving into this dataset, our goal is to uncover usage patterns, identify peak hours for bike rentals in different city areas, and explore user behavior distinctions between subscribers and casual riders. This analysis aims to provide actionable information to urban planners, transportation authorities, and stakeholders, supporting data-driven decision-making and fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility solutions.
